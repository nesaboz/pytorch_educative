This repo covers my journey to study PyTorch. Following a principle to
never learn from just one book, I will be experimenting with many
projects borrowed from following 3 resources: - PyTorch: Step by Step
[books](https://pytorchstepbystep.com/) (3 of them) by Daniel Voigt
Godoy - Excellent
[course](https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/) by Yann LeCun
& Alfredo Canziani - Practical Deep Learning for Coders
[course](https://course.fast.ai/) by Jeremy Howard.
